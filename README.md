# Crypto_Tools

This repository is for tools that help people to write and update files. The tools have been created in MS Excel, so that you can easily see/update the tools as you wish. I leave the calculated fields visible, so that you can see what they do that you are using a safe file. The sheets are protected, in order to keep the calculated fields protected. If you want to make changed you can unprotect the sheets; there is no password.

If you have ideas for improvement, please let me know on Telegram Channel	https://t.me/crypto_tools
